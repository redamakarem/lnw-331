Our high-end vibrators are made from locally-sourced recycled and recyclable materials but most importantly they have a separate base and head that is interchangeable. So once you own a battery base unit, you can buy separate heads, creating multiple toys in one. This is not only better for your pocket, but it’s better for the earth too. <\/p><p>We’ve thought about every detail right down to the soy ink we use on our FSC card packaging and we even offer a repair and recycle scheme, helping to ensure your vibe lasts for life.<\/p><p>Our entire range has fast become a cult classic and is raved about in the sex toy testing community. We’ve been nominated for a ton of awards including best sex toy of the year, most progressive toy brand of the year and also a prestigious green product award. <\/p><p>We’re on a mission to help the world, one orgasm at a time! <\/p>","text_size":2,"text_columns":1,"align_text":"text-left","bg_color":"#ffffff","button_text":"","button_url":"","button_color":"btn--neutral","button_style":"hero__btn btn btn--large btn--outline caps"}},"6f298f96-56ac-4279-a8c6-541ea973ca62":{"type":"video","settings":{"video_link_bg":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0292\/5166\/6013\/files\/ANIMATION1.mp4?v=1648646546","video_link":"","bg_position":"center-center","overlay_opacity":0,"overlay_color":"#000000","title":"","description":"","flex_align":"align--middle-center","link_text":"","link":"","button_color":"btn--white","button_style":"hero__btn btn btn--large btn--outline caps"}}},"block_order":["1648645697bcbda91b-1","6f298f96-56ac-4279-a8c6-541ea973ca62"],"settings":{"height":"screen-height-two-thirds","padding":true,"borders":false}},"1648645700fbc1b0b3":{"type":"section-product","blocks":{"1648645700a5c2c68a-0":{"type":"price_and_title","settings":{"subheading_option":"none","show_rating":true,"enable_star_rating":true,"show_rating_count":false}},"1648645700a5c2c68a-1":{"type":"form","settings":{"info_page":"","show_labels":true,"show_quantity":true,"show_payment_button":true,"subscriptions_enable_selectors":true}},"1648645700a5c2c68a-2":{"type":"tab_richtext","settings":{"show_read_more":false,"style":"tabs","title_1":"","raw_content_1":"","title_2":"","raw_content_2":"<p>You can use product metafields to assign content to this tab that is unique to an individual product.
